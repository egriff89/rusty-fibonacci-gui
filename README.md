# rusty-fibonacci-gui

GUI version of my [Rusty Fibonacci CLI](https://github.com/egriff89/rusty-fibonacci) utility, powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). Still very much a work in progress, but still technically works.

## Todo
- [x] ~~Fix issues with generating numbers when `nth` is larger than 47.~~
- [x] ~~Add CSS to make it actually look nice.~~
- [ ] Format strings to make numbers more readable.
